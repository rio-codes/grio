# grio
a simple microblog that tells your story

grio makes tiny status posts and keeps a history of them. It is a microblog apart from social media. There is no commenting, no following, no likes, no reposting, no feeds. Think AIM status updates to your website.

## cli
grio has a client side cli that uploads your posts to a webserver. It will soon be documented here. Possible future features include a desktop gui, web gui, and mobile app for posting on the go.

## server js script
Include a javascript file and add a bit of chrome on your webpage and your post will be displayed. Optionally you can keep a history page, kind of like a feed but just you. I am not sure what to call this because "grlog" is the worst thing I've ever heard.

There may be more features to come, but this is more of a proof of concept.
