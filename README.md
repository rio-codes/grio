# grio
a simple microblog that tells your story

grio makes tiny status posts and keeps a history of them. It is a microblog apart from social media. There is no commenting, no following, no reposting, no feeds. Think AIM status updates to your website.

## cli
grio has a client side cli that uploads your posts to a webserver. It will soon be documented here.

## server js script
Include a javascript file on your webpage and your post will be displayed.

There may be more features to come, but this is more of a proof of concept.
